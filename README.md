# Your-Photo-Kit
This is the repository for my back-end capstone for NSS called Your Photo Kit. The app allows you to enter and log your photo gear and include the purchase price, date and serial number of those products.  You can view and print a list of your gear with the "Gear Report" and see a running total of the cost of your gear.  You can also filter by title and year (you can search for "Sony" to see all of your Sony gear and add a year (Sony 2019) to further drill down to see just the Sony gear you bought in 2019.

You can also create a trip and choose what gear you'd like to take.  The app can serve as a "packing list" for your photography trip.

This is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application.
